# WaterTIME-Website
A work in progress at www.mizumadness.com. A collection of web pages (a Homepage, Image Gallary, Game, and Contact Page) centered around a quirky water theme. Currently using html, css, and javascript (vanilla and JQuery) with the intention of incorporating a back-end language for data collection and dynamism.
